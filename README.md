The goal of this project was to take raw survey data and transform it into an interactive and insightful dashboard. Key areas of analysis include:

* Salary Distribution: Understanding salary ranges across different roles, years of experience, and countries.

* Job Satisfaction: Gauging overall satisfaction levels and identifying factors that contribute to it.

* Demographics: Exploring the age, gender, and educational backgrounds of data professionals.
* Skill Sets: Highlighting popular programming languages, tools, and platforms used in the industry.
* Industry Trends: Identifying common roles, industries, and company sizes.
